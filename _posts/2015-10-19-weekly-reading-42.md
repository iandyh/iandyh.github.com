I was out for hiking last weekend. So I was not able to write #41. 

# Apache Kafka, Samza, and the Unix Philosophy of Distributed Data

[http://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-samza-and-the-unix-philosophy-of-distributed-data](http://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-samza-and-the-unix-philosophy-of-distributed-data)

Martin Kleppmenn talks about the philosophy behind using Kafka in distributed system. Comparing to the Unix, Kafa is the new pipe. 

His blog has lots of good read.

# Holistic Configuration Managementat Facebook

[http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp15/current/2015-Monterey/008-tang-online.pdf](http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp15/current/2015-Monterey/008-tang-online.pdf)

Facebooks' configuration management tools. They write code as configs and store the configs generated by code in Git. Interestingly, this is how they solve the problem of configuration dependencies: 1. The code to generate configs has dependencies. 2. An interpreter will grab the dependency from the code and figure out the dependency. 

Lots of stuff in this paper.
