The project I've been working on is roughly done. I might publish it next week or so.

As a result, I have not been reading too much. (Considering I also need to study Japanese...)

# agentzh's Nginx Tutorial

[https://openresty.org/download/agentzh-nginx-tutorials-en.html](https://openresty.org/download/agentzh-nginx-tutorials-en.html)

For any one who wants to run Nginx in the production. agentzh's tutorial is a must read. It explains all the surprises and quirks you might encounter during development. However, I do think the tutorial could be organised better since now the structure is more of bottom-to-top form and lack of systematic explanation on the reason behind nginx's configuration design.
