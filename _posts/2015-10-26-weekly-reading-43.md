This week has been lazy. Only read one proper article. 

# Enterprise Integration Using REST

[http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html](http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html)

It's an old article, which tries to persuade people to switch their architecture to micro services connected by REST. The article addressed the problem you will encounter during the process. Interestingly, the author believers versioning is the last thing to solve dependencies hell. Tolerant deserialisation should be firstly deployed to delay versioning. (I am actually kind of agree on this).
